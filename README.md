goraptor
========

Go bindings for the Raptor RDF parser / serializer.

This is a updated version of
[goraptor](https://bitbucket.org/ww/goraptor)
 written by William Waites <ww@styx.org>.  We've done
a little bit of cleanup and testing with Go 1.1.1.  This library is
not complete.

For basic usage, see [Documentation.txt](Documentation.txt).

Prerequisites
===============

Install the development libraries for Raptor version 2.  On
Debian / Ubuntu run:

    sudo apt-get install libraptor2-dev
